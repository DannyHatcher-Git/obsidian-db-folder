## Database Information

You can change the database name and description in the database settings.

## Sticky First Column

You can make the first column sticky in the database settings to make it always visible even when scrolling horizontally.

## Pagination

To help with displaying a lot of data, by default the database displays only 10 rows and allows changing the pages using the top bar. You can change the number of rows displayed per page in the database settings.

## Row Height

In the database settings under `cell size`, you can change the row height between 3 options (compact, normal, wide).

## Filtering

You can either search for any metadata displayed in the database, or you can create a filter using the top bar. You can use multiple filters at the same time. The button on the left activates and deactivates the filter.

> The database filter holds priority over the dataview query source filter.

## Refresh Database

There is no actual refresh button, but you can use the `activate/desactive filter` button to refresh the database.

## Sorting

You can sort one column or multiple columns from the column's menu in descending or ascending order. The sort priority is displayed as a number next the arrow in the column header. To remove the sort, just use the column menu.

## Database Markdown

You can view the database markdown note by using the command `open as markdown` in obsidian menu or in the header menu.

## Embedding Database

You can embed a database by using this format `![[database file name.md]]`, it'll show a dataview query of the database.

## Exporting Data

You can export the database into **CSV** format using the database menu.

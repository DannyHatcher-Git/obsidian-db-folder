Just like dataview, you can use multiple sources for your data :

1. **Current folder**: this will match all files within the selected folder when creating the database;
2. **Tag**: this will match all files with the given tag ;
3. **Incoming_link**: this will match all files that have links to the select file ;
4. **Outgoing_link**: this will match all files that have links from the select file ;
5. **Dataview**: you can put your dataview query (DQL) without the first line `TABLE columns` as the plugin will autocomplete this part.

> If you want to combine multiple tags or links or folders, you'll have to use the **Dataview source**.

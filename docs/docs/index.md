# Welcome to Obsidian Database Folder!

This plugin allows you to create [Notion](https://www.notion.so)'s like databases in your [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) Vault.

Using the search engine of the popular [Dataview plugin](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview), you can view the content of your notes and edit the fields directly from the table without the need to open the note.

You **need** to have Dataview installed to use this plugin.

## How Can I Add a Database?

There are 3 ways of creating a database:

1. By executing the command `DB folder: create a new database table` ;
2. By clicking on the custom sidebar icon ;
3. By right-clicking on a folder where you want to store your notes and your database.

## How Do I Access Settings?

There are two types of settings (plugin setting and database setting). You can access the database settings from the obsidian menu or from the header menu. The database settings take priority over the plugin setting.
